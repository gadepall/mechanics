\begin{enumerate}[label=\thesection.\arabic*,ref=\thesection.\theenumi]
	\item On an open ground, a motorist follows a track that turns to his left by an angle of $60\degree$ after every 500m.  Starting from a given turn, specify the displacement of the motorist at the third, sixth and eighth turn.  Compare the magnitude of the displacement with the total path length covered by the motorist in each case.
	\item Rain is falling vertically with a speed of 30 ms$^{-1}$.  A woman rides a bicycle with a speed of 10 ms$^{-1}$ in the north to south direction.  What is the direction in which she should hold her umbrella.
	\item A man can swim with a speed of 4 km/h in 
		still water.  How long does he take to cross a river 1 km wide if the river flows steadily at 3 km/h and he makes strokes normal to the river current? How far down the river does he go when he reaches the other bank?
	\item In a harbour, wind is blowing at the speed of 72 km/h and the flag on the mast of a boat anchored in the harbour flutters along the N-E direction. If the boat starts moving at a speed of 51 km/h to the north, what is the direction of the flag on the mast of the boat?
