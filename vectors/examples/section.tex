\item To conduct Sports Day activities, in your rectangular shaped school                   
ground ABCD, lines have 
drawn with chalk powder at a                 
distance of 1m each. 100 flower pots have been placed at a distance of 1m 
from each other along AD, as shown 
in Fig. 7.12. Niharika runs $ \frac {1}{4} $th the 
distance AD on the 2nd line and 
posts a green flag. Preet runs $ \frac {1}{5} $th 
the distance AD on the eighth line 
and posts a red flag. What is the 
distance between both the flags? If 
Rashmi has to post a blue flag exactly 
halfway between the line segment 
joining the two flags, where should 
she post her flag?
